# ðŸ§  Project TODO â€“ Sales Conversion Analytics Dashboard

This file tracks outstanding tasks and next priorities across the full project scope.

---

## âœ… Completed

- Set up Streamlit dashboard framework
- Implemented lead scoring model with event category-specific half-life calculation
- Added exponential decay formula for time-based lead scoring
- Enhanced data processing to handle missing critical fields
- Created data completeness score system with quality flags
- Improved visualization error handling with informative messages
- Added data quality filtering options in sidebar

---

## ðŸ”§ In Progress

### ðŸ”¹ Data Quality Improvements
- [ ] Further enhance robustness against missing data fields
- [ ] Add visualization of data completeness by field
- [ ] Improve data imputation strategies for critical fields

### ðŸ”¹ Visualization Enhancements
- [ ] Fix remaining empty charts in timing factors section
- [ ] Ensure proper data type validation across all visualizations
- [ ] Add toggle for showing/hiding incomplete data sections

---

## ðŸš€ Next Features

- [ ] **Per-Category Model Segmentation**: Implement separate lead scoring models per event category
- [ ] **Decay Curve Visualization**: Add interactive visualization of decay curves for different event types
- [ ] **Lead Velocity**: Measure pipeline speed by event type or lead source
- [ ] **Data Completion Insights**: Add AI-generated insights about data quality patterns

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Data completeness threshold currently set to 0.5 (50%) by default
- Use MISTRAL_API_KEY for AI-powered insights
- Decay function uses exponential formula: score * 2^(-days/half_life)
