1. Verify Your Tab Indexes & Imports
Double-check that the order of tabs = st.tabs([...]) in app.py matches the order you‚Äôre using when you do with tabs[1]: # Feature Correlation, with tabs[2]: # Lead Scoring, etc.

Ensure you‚Äôre importing the right render functions for each tab. If you have both feature_correlation.py and new_feature_correlation.py, make sure app.py points at the one with the real code.

python
Copy
Edit
# BAD: importing the stub
from feature_correlation import plot_correlation  
# GOOD: import your working code
from new_feature_correlation import render_feature_correlation  
2. Add Per-Tab Smoke-Tests
Wrap each tab‚Äôs render call in a try/except so you can see any hidden exceptions:

python
Copy
Edit
with tabs[1]:
    st.subheader("üîç Feature Correlation")
    try:
        render_feature_correlation(df)
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Feature Correlation failed: {e}")
        import traceback; st.text(traceback.format_exc())
That will surface any missing‚Äêcolumn or type errors directly in the UI instead of silently failing.

3. Print the DataFrame Shape & Columns Inside Each Tab
Right at the top of each render function, drop:

python
Copy
Edit
st.write("DEBUG:", df.shape, "columns:", df.columns.tolist())
That confirms you‚Äôre passing a non-empty DataFrame with the expected schema into each module.

4. Confirm You Didn‚Äôt Shadow df
Search your code for any local assignments like df = something_else inside a tab that might overwrite the filtered/merged leads DataFrame with something empty.

bash
Copy
Edit
grep -R "df =" -n app.py
Make sure your central df = raw_df (or filtered version) is the one used everywhere.

5. Check Your requirements.txt
If you moved any plotting code into a new file that uses Plotly, Altair, or Statsmodels, verify those libraries are listed in requirements.txt so Streamlit can import them at runtime.

6. Unit‚ÄêTest Each Render Function
In your test_app.py, write minimal tests:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
from new_conversion_tab import render_conversion_tab

def test_conversion_tab_runs_without_error(tmp_path, capsys):
    # create a tiny DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'outcome':[1,0],
        'created':['2025-01-01','2025-01-08'],
        'booking_type':['A','B']
    })
    # call render; should not raise
    render_conversion_tab(df)
Running pytest will catch any missing‚Äêcolumn issues before you even launch the app.

7. Lint & Format
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
black . && flake8 .
to catch typos in function names or wrong imports that could silently break your tabs.

Pick one of these tactics‚Äîlike adding that try/except around a tab‚Äîand you‚Äôll get immediate feedback in the UI about what‚Äôs failing. Let me know what error pops up, and we‚Äôll zero in on the fix!
