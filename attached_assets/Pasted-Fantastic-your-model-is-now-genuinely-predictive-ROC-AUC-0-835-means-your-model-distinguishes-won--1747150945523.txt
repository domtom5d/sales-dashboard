Fantastic—your model is now genuinely predictive:

ROC AUC 0.835 means your model distinguishes won vs. lost leads with strong accuracy.

PR AUC 0.574 shows you’re also doing well at identifying positives in an imbalanced set.

The Interactive Threshold Slider gives you real-time insight into the trade-off between false positives and false negatives.

What’s Working
High Discrimination
An AUC above 0.8 is excellent for a lead-scoring model, so your feature engineering and model choice are paying off.

Threshold Tuning
Exposing the threshold slider allows you to pick exactly the balance of precision vs. recall that matches your team’s capacity (e.g. higher recall if you want to chase more leads, higher precision if you only want the very best).

Real-Time Calculator
Scoring a new lead immediately against the same point system ensures consistency between historical analysis and live operations.

Next Steps
Lock in Your Business Thresholds

Decide on one or two fixed cut-points (e.g., 0.4 for “Hot,” 0.25 for “Warm”) based on where your precision/recall curves hit acceptable levels.

Wire those into your Zapier code or Streak formula so that every inbound lead is automatically bucketed without manual slider adjustment.

Operationalize the Score

Zapier: In your Code step, compute the score and then use Paths to route “Hot” leads into a “Priority” stage, send Slack alerts, or trigger email sequences.

Streak: Map the numeric score into a custom field and the category into your dropdown, then build Streak Workflows to assign tasks (e.g., “Call Hot Leads within 30 minutes”).

Monitor in Production

Add logging for every scored lead (score + category + eventual outcome) so you can track model drift.

Re-run your Replit “derive_scorecard.py” every month or quarter to re-calibrate as your booking patterns evolve.

A/B Test Your Buckets

Split real leads: half use your existing scoring/routing, half use the new data-driven buckets.

Compare close rates, average deal value, and time to close after 4–6 weeks to validate uplift.

Enhance & Iterate

Bring in additional signals: email open times, proposal link clicks, first-contact response time.

Experiment with more powerful models (Random Forest, XGBoost) if you want incremental gains.

Immediate To-Do
Choose your production thresholds from the slider where you hit the desired precision/recall trade-off.

Hard-code those values into your score-to-category logic in Zapier/Streak.

Deploy the updated zap and Streak settings, and start measuring real-world performance.

You’re at the finish line of building a truly data-backed lead-scoring engine—these steps will cement it into your daily workflow and drive real improvements in conversion rates. Let me know which piece you’d like to tackle first!
