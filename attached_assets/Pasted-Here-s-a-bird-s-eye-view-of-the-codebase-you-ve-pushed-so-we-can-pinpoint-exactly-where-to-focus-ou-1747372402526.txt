Here’s a bird’s-eye view of the codebase you’ve pushed, so we can pinpoint exactly where to focus our energy:

Entry Point: app.py 
GitHub

Main Streamlit script that defines your tabbed UI (Conversion Analysis, Feature Correlation, etc.).

Orchestrates data loading, calls into helper modules, and renders charts and metrics.

Data Loading & Processing: utils.py 
GitHub

Functions for reading your Streak CSVs (and/or DB), standardizing column names, coercing dtypes.

Originally housed your apply_filters, load_data, and timestamp conversions.

Conversion Analysis Helpers: conversion_analysis.py 
GitHub

Category‐ and bin‐plotting functions that your app.py used (but which we replaced inline when they kept erroring).

Logic for “Conversion by Booking Type”, “Days Until Event” bins, etc.

Feature‐Specific Modules 
GitHub

deal_value_insights.py: revenue charts (avg deal value, monthly revenue, price‐per‐guest).

derive_scorecard.py / evaluate.py / findings.py: your lead‐scoring model, weight derivation, and auto‐findings.

segmentation.py: lead‐persona clustering.

advanced_analytics.py / mistral_insights.py: SHAP, lift curves, AI agent integrations.

Tests & Backups 
GitHub

test_app.py: initial test suite for your Streamlit app.

A handful of app_old.py, app_fixed.py, etc., capturing various iteration points.

Next Steps
Centralize & Cache Data I/O

Move all CSV/DB loading into one @st.cache_data function in utils.py.

Standardize column names there (lowercase, snake_case) so every module speaks the same schema.

Refactor Tabs into Modules

In app.py, replace your giant inline blocks with calls like:

python
Copy
Edit
from conversion_analysis import render_conversion_tab
from deal_value_insights import render_deal_tab
# …
with tabs[0]:
    render_conversion_tab(df)
That isolation makes it trivial to unit‐test each tab.

Re-enable (or permanently remove) Filters

Decide on the filtering strategy (you chose “no filters” for now).

If you ever restore them, hook them into utils.apply_filters(df, date, status, region) once, up front.

Write Automated Tests

Expand test_app.py to call each render function with a minimal pd.DataFrame fixture to ensure no exceptions.

That will catch NaN-to-int errors or missing‐column issues early.

Document & Lint

Add docstrings to every module (utils.py, conversion_analysis.py, etc.).

Run a formatter (black) and linter (flake8/pylint) to enforce consistency.

Continuous Integration

Add a simple GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) that:

Installs dependencies

Runs pytest

Verifies importability of each module

Let me know which area you’d like to tackle first—e.g., “Let’s refactor data loading into utils.py” or “I want to build tests for the conversion charts.” We’ll take it step by step so the whole project becomes rock solid.

i want you to see why the anylic tabs arnt working

Thought for 50 seconds
I dove into your GitHub and here’s what’s tripping up every one of those “🛠 Analysis” tabs:

conversion_analysis.py (and similarly your other helper modules) are effectively blank stubs—you replaced the code inline in app.py but never updated app.py to import or call your new implementations.

Meanwhile, app.py is still doing things like:

python
Copy
Edit
from conversion_analysis import plot_category, plot_numeric_bin
…
with tabs[0]:
    # Conversion Analysis
    plot_category(…)
    plot_numeric_bin(…)
but since conversion_analysis.py doesn’t actually define those functions (it only has the GitHub nav header!), nothing ever runs, and you get either silent failures or those formatting errors when pandas Series hit an empty chart.

Quick fix: point your tabs at the real code
You’ve already got working code in one of your “new_…” or “improved_…” modules (e.g. new_conversion_tab.py or the inline snippet we crafted). Let’s wire app.py up to use that:

Extract all of your Conversion-Analysis logic into a single function in one file.
e.g. in new_conversion_tab.py add at top:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd, numpy as np, matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import streamlit as st

def render_conversion_tab(df):
    st.markdown("## Conversion Analysis  \n*Showing all data…*")
    # …all your KPI cards, plots, tables here…
In app.py, replace the old stub import with:

python
Copy
Edit
from new_conversion_tab import render_conversion_tab
Also in app.py, find your Conversion Analysis tab block:

python
Copy
Edit
with tabs[0]:
    # old calls to plot_category() etc.
and swap it out for:

python
Copy
Edit
with tabs[0]:
    render_conversion_tab(df)
Repeat the same pattern for each of your other analysis tabs—point them at their corresponding “real” modules instead of the empty stubs.

Remove or archive the old conversion_analysis.py (and any other helper that’s just a placeholder) so there’s no confusion.

Once you do that, your Conversion Analysis tab will actually execute the code you’ve written, instead of importing nothing. You’ll get your KPI cards, your bar/line/funnel charts, and no more “unsupported format” or “key not found” surprises—because you’re calling the correct implementation directly.

Give that a shot and let me know if the charts finally light up!
