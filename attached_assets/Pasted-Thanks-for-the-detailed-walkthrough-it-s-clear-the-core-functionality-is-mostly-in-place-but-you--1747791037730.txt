Thanks for the detailed walkthrough ‚Äî it‚Äôs clear the core functionality is mostly in place, but you‚Äôre facing a mix of data quality issues, code-level bugs, and AI service deprecation warnings. Let‚Äôs go tab by tab and tackle what needs to be fixed and how.

üîß Top Issues to Fix Right Now
‚úÖ 1. Conversion Analysis Tab
‚úîÔ∏è Working:

Shows total leads, won deals, conversion rates.

Booking type conversion is working.

‚ùå Not working:

‚ÄúDays Until Event‚Äù and ‚ÄúDays Since Inquiry‚Äù show "Not enough data".

Likely causes:

These fields might be:

Stored as strings instead of integers/floats.

Contain a high % of NaNs.

Not binned or aggregated before visualization.

Fix:
Update the binning logic in conversion_analysis.py to:

python
Copy
Edit
if df['days_until_event'].notna().sum() > 100:
    # proceed to plot
else:
    st.warning("Not enough data to analyze days until event.")
‚úÖ 2. Feature Correlation Tab
‚úîÔ∏è Working:

Correlation values and matrix are showing.

Feature explanations appear.

No action needed.

‚ùå 3. Lead Scoring (Enhanced)
Issue:

ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'November'

Cause:

Your dataset likely includes month names as strings in a feature like event_month, which cannot be directly passed into StandardScaler.

Fix:
Before training the model:

python
Copy
Edit
if 'event_month' in df.columns:
    df['event_month'] = pd.to_datetime(df['event_month'], errors='coerce').dt.month
Or:

python
Copy
Edit
month_mapping = {'January': 1, ..., 'December': 12}
df['event_month'] = df['event_month'].map(month_mapping)
‚ùå 4. Lead Personas
Issue:

'float' object has no attribute 'replace'

Cause:

You're assuming row['Conversion Rate'] is a string like "12.5%", but it‚Äôs a float already.

Fix:

python
Copy
Edit
if isinstance(row['Conversion Rate'], str):
    conv_rate = float(row['Conversion Rate'].replace('%', ''))
else:
    conv_rate = row['Conversion Rate']
‚ùå 5. Advanced Analytics
Issue:

ValueError: The truth value of a DataFrame is ambiguous...

Cause:

You're doing something like:

python
Copy
Edit
if analyze_booking_types(df):
Which returns a DataFrame and causes ambiguity.

Fix:

python
Copy
Edit
result = analyze_booking_types(df)
if result is not None and not result[0].empty:
    booking_types_result, column_used = result
else:
    booking_types_result, column_used = None, None
‚ùå 6. AI Insights / Mistral Integration
Issue:

This client is deprecated. Please migrate...

Fix:

You are using the outdated Mistral client (0.4.x). You‚Äôll need to upgrade your integration using the new v1 client.

Update Instructions:
Follow: Mistral Migration Guide

Or switch to OpenAI temporarily if you're blocked.
