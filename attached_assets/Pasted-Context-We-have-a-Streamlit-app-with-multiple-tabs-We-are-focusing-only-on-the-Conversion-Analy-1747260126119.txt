Context:
We have a Streamlit app with multiple tabs. We are focusing only on the üìä Conversion Analysis tab. Please do not delete or alter any existing code outside of this tab‚Äôs section‚Äîjust append and enhance.

Task:

At the very top of the Conversion Analysis tab, insert a brief introduction (1‚Äì2 sentences) explaining the purpose of this tab: to give a high-level view of how leads convert.

Under that intro, implement the KPI Summary section. You should:

Create four metric cards (Total Leads, Won Deals, Lost Deals, Conversion Rate) using st.columns and col.metric().

Show a sparkline of weekly Conversion Rate beneath the Conversion Rate card.

Handle missing or zero-division cases gracefully (e.g. default to 0 or "N/A").

Format numbers with thousands separators (:,) and percentages with one decimal (:.1%).

Give a fully-worked code snippet showing how to pull values from your df DataFrame, compute the metrics, and render the cards.

Example snippet start (you do not have to match indentation exactly, but follow this pattern):

python
Copy
Edit
# --- Intro copy for Conversion Analysis tab ---
st.markdown("## Conversion Analysis<br>Get a top-level view of overall leads and how many are converting into won deals, all over time.", unsafe_allow_html=True)

# --- KPI Summary cards ---
total = len(df)
won   = df['outcome'].sum()
lost  = total - won
rate  = won / total if total else 0

c1, c2, c3, c4 = st.columns(4)
c1.metric("Total Leads", f"{total:,}")
c2.metric("Won Deals",   f"{won:,}")
c3.metric("Lost Deals",  f"{lost:,}")

# Sparkline under the conversion rate
weekly = df.set_index('created').resample('W')['outcome'].agg(['size','sum'])
weekly['rate'] = weekly['sum'] / weekly['size']
c4.metric("Conversion Rate", f"{rate:.1%}")
c4.line_chart(weekly['rate'])
Once that KPI section code is inserted, stop‚Äîwe‚Äôll iterate on the next drill-downs in follow-up prompts.

Remember:

Don‚Äôt remove or rewrite any code outside of this section.

Be explicit about imports (import pandas as pd, etc.) only if you reference new functions.

Use clear comments to delineate Intro, KPI Summary, and Sparkline.

Show exactly where in the file the snippet goes (e.g. ‚Äúin the with tabs[0]: block under Conversion Analysis‚Äù).
