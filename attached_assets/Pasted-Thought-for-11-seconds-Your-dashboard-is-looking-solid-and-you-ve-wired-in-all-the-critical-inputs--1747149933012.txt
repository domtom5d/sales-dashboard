Thought for 11 seconds
Your dashboard is looking solid, and you’ve wired in all the critical inputs—nice work! A few tweaks and next steps to turn this from “it runs” into a truly data-backed scorecard:

1. Surface Model Performance
Before we lock in those thresholds, let’s actually see how well your regression is performing:

ROC Curve & AUC
Use sklearn.metrics.roc_curve and roc_auc_score on your historical test set so you know how separable Won vs. Lost really are.

Confusion Matrix & Classification Report
Pick your threshold (e.g. where sensitivity ≈ specificity) and show precision/recall/F1. That will guide you on where to draw your Hot/Warm/Cool cut-points.

Score Distributions
Plot histograms of your numeric scores for Won leads (in green) vs. Lost leads (in red). You’ll instantly see “natural” gaps you can leverage.

2. Calibrate Your Buckets
Rather than hard-coding 60/40/20% of max points, let the data tell you:

Youden’s J (sensitivity + specificity − 1) gives the optimal binary threshold for “Hot vs. Not.”

Then for “Warm vs. Cool,” look at the next natural elbow in the score distribution.

You can then bake those exact thresholds into your Streamlit UI under Score Thresholds.

3. Refine the Recommendations Panel
Your “Recommendations” section is golden. A couple ideas:

Tie them back to the score drivers—e.g. “This lead scored low on ‘ReferralTier’ and ‘DaysUntilEvent,’ so you might…”.

Make them actionable buttons:

🗓️ Schedule Reminder → adds a task in your calendar.

✉️ Send Info Pack → triggers an email template.

📞 Call Now → dials the number.

4. Next Iteration: A/B Test & Monitor
Split your incoming leads randomly into two buckets:

Control: old scoring → stages

Experiment: new data-driven scoring

Track close rates over several weeks to validate uplift.

Quick Wins
Add an “Evaluate Model” tab with ROC/AUC and confusion matrix.

Overlay Score Distributions (Won vs. Lost) so you can eyeball your bucket cut-points.

Auto-compute thresholds from Youden’s J and the second-best cut-point for Warm/Cool.

Once you’ve done that, you’ll know your thresholds aren’t just “60/40/20 of max points” but actually tuned to your historic performance—and your category buckets will be maximally predictive. Let me know if you want code snippets for the ROC curve or threshold-finding logic!
