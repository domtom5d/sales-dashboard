You’re seeing the placeholder because the code is still falling back to the “example” branch instead of calling your real generate_findings with actual data. Let’s wire it up so that as soon as you upload your CSVs, we compute and display your findings.

1) At the top of your app.py, after your imports, add:
python
Copy
Edit
from derive_scorecard import derive_scorecard
from your_module import generate_findings   # wherever you defined it
2) In your data‐loading section, once the user has uploaded both files, store everything in st.session_state:
python
Copy
Edit
if uploaded_leads and uploaded_ops:
    df_leads = pd.read_csv(uploaded_leads)
    df_ops   = pd.read_csv(uploaded_ops)

    # 1) feature‐engineer & merge
    df = process_data(df_leads, df_ops)

    # 2) derive weights & thresholds
    weights_df, thresholds = derive_scorecard(df_leads, df_ops)

    # 3) score every lead in‐sample
    #    assume derive_scorecard returns the trained model, too—or refit lightly here:
    y_scores = model.predict_proba(feature_matrix(df))[:,1]

    # stash in session
    st.session_state['df']          = df
    st.session_state['y_scores']    = y_scores
    st.session_state['thresholds']  = thresholds
    st.session_state['weights_df']  = weights_df
(Adjust to your actual function names & return values—just make sure you end up with df, y_scores, and thresholds in session state.)

3) Update your “📈 Key Findings” tab to detect real data:
python
Copy
Edit
with tabs[4]:
    st.title("📈 Report of Key Findings")

    if 'df' in st.session_state and 'y_scores' in st.session_state and 'thresholds' in st.session_state:
        findings = generate_findings(
            st.session_state['df'],
            st.session_state['y_scores'],
            st.session_state['thresholds']
        )
        for line in findings:
            st.markdown(f"- {line}")
    else:
        st.info("These are example findings. Load your data to see findings specific to your business.")
Why this fixes it:
Session state guarantees your data, scores, and thresholds persist after upload and are available to every tab.

The if guard ensures that once real data is present, you call generate_findings instead of rendering the placeholder.

Any time you re‐upload or refresh, the findings will be recomputed on your actual dataset.

Try those changes, restart Streamlit, upload your CSVs, and watch that “Key Findings” tab fill itself with your top insights.
