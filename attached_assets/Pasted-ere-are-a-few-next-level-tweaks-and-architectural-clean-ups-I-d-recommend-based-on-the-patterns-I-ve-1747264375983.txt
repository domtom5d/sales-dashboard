ere are a few next-level tweaks and architectural clean-ups I’d recommend—based on the patterns I’ve seen in your code—to make your Conversion Analysis tab (and the overall app) more robust, maintainable, and performant:

1. Centralize & Cache Data Loading
Single Source of Truth: Load and normalize your CSVs (or DB) in one place—say, in a load_data() function in utils.py—and call that once.

Cache It: Wrap that loader in @st.cache_data so you’re not re-reading and re-parsing hundreds of megabytes on every interaction.

python
Copy
Edit
@st.cache_data
def load_and_normalize(leads_file, ops_file):
    # read CSVs, merge, coerce dtypes, standardize column names
    return df
2. Consolidate Filtering Logic
Extract all your filter steps into a single helper, e.g. apply_filters(df, date_range, status, regions).

Call that before you instantiate any tabs or charts, then pass the filtered df everywhere.

That eliminates scattered re-filtering and ensures consistency.

3. Modularize Each Section
Rather than one giant app.py, break your Conversion Analysis tab into:

conversion_analysis.py → all the plotting & metric functions

kpi_cards.py → KPI summary

category_charts.py → booking/referral/event/marketing plots

timing_charts.py → time-based charts

Then in app.py you simply:

python
Copy
Edit
from conversion_analysis import (
    render_kpi_cards,
    render_category_charts,
    render_timing_charts,
    render_quality_checks,
)

with tabs[0]:
    render_kpi_cards(df)
    render_category_charts(df)
    render_timing_charts(df)
    render_quality_checks(df)
4. Lean on Streamlit Layouts & Spinners
Wrap expensive operations in with st.spinner("Loading…"): so users get feedback.

Use st.expander("Show raw table") for your raw-data section so the page doesn’t feel endless.

Consider st.columns for side-by-side comparisons (e.g. booking vs. referral).

5. Bullet-Proof Type Handling
Coerce every numeric column once up front (e.g. df['days_until_event'] = pd.to_numeric(...)) and fill or drop NAs.

Then all downstream functions can assume correct dtypes and never hit those '<'' not supported or NaN→int conversion errors.

6. Interactive / Drill-Through
Switch to Plotly/Altair for your bar charts so you can click a bar (e.g. “Corporate”) and have the rest of the dashboard automatically re-filter to just that bucket.

That gives you true “drill-down” without writing new filters each time.

7. Self-Documenting Configuration
Move magic numbers (like your conversion-bin edges, minimum sample sizes, score thresholds) into a config.py at the top of your project.

That way tweaking “only show buckets ≥50 leads” or “hot threshold = 0.23” doesn’t require hunting through 3 files.

8. Add Assertions & Logging
At key points (after filtering, after type coercion), insert sanity checks:

python
Copy
Edit
assert 'outcome' in df, "Outcome column missing!"
assert df['outcome'].isin([0,1]).all(), "Unexpected outcome values"
And sprinkle in st.text(f"Filtered to {len(df)} rows") or logger.info() calls so you can see exactly how many records survive each filter.

TL;DR
Cache your data load.

Extract and call a single apply_filters() up front.

Break your tab into reusable modules/functions.

Use spinners, expanders, and columns for better UX.

Normalize types once, then plot/format fearlessly.

Embrace interactivity with Plotly for true drill-downs.

Centralize all tunable parameters in a config.py.

Assert and log so you always know what’s in your DataFrame.

Applying these will make your Conversion Analysis lightning-fast, error-free, and a joy for you (and anyone else) to extend in the future. Let me know which one you’d like to tackle first!
