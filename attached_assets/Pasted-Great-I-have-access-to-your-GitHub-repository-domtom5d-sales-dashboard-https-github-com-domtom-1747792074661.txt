Great! I have access to your GitHub repository: [domtom5d/sales-dashboard](https://github.com/domtom5d/sales-dashboard). Let's address the issue with the Enhanced Lead Scoring tab, which is currently throwing the error:

```
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'November'
```

This error indicates that the model is encountering a string value `'November'` in a column expected to contain numeric data. To resolve this, we need to identify the column causing the issue and convert it to a numeric format.

### Step 1: Identify the Problematic Column

Based on the error message, it's likely that a column representing months (e.g., `'event_month'`) contains string values like `'November'`. We need to convert these string representations of months to their corresponding numeric values.

### Step 2: Update the Data Preprocessing Function

Locate the data preprocessing function in your codebase, which is likely in a file such as `enhanced_lead_scoring.py`. Within this function, add logic to convert month names to numeric values. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import pandas as pd

def preprocess_data(df):
    # Convert 'event_month' from string to numeric
    if 'event_month' in df.columns:
        month_mapping = {
            'January': 1, 'February': 2, 'March': 3, 'April': 4,
            'May': 5, 'June': 6, 'July': 7, 'August': 8,
            'September': 9, 'October': 10, 'November': 11, 'December': 12
        }
        df['event_month'] = df['event_month'].map(month_mapping)
    
    # Continue with other preprocessing steps
    # ...

    return df
```

Ensure that this preprocessing function is called before the model training step.

### Step 3: Validate the Fix

After implementing the changes:

1. Run the Enhanced Lead Scoring model to ensure that the error no longer occurs.
2. Verify that the model's performance metrics (e.g., ROC AUC, accuracy) are as expected.
3. Check that the score distribution and other related visualizations render correctly.

### Step 4: Commit and Push the Changes

Once you've confirmed that the issue is resolved:

```bash
git add enhanced_lead_scoring.py
git commit -m "Fix: Convert 'event_month' from string to numeric in preprocessing"
git push
```

This will update your GitHub repository with the fix.
