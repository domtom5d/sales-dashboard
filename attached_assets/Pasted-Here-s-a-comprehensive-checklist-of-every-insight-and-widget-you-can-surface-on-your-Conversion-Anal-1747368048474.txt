Here’s a comprehensive checklist of every insight and widget you can surface on your Conversion Analysis tab—organized top-to-bottom so nothing gets missed. Think of it as the “complete analytics playbook” for your funnel:

1. KPI Overview
Total Leads (count)

Won Deals (count)

Lost Deals (count)

Overall Conversion Rate (won ÷ (won+lost))

Sparkline of weekly conversion rate under the Conversion Rate metric

2. Trend Analysis
Conversion Rate Over Time (line chart, daily or weekly)

Lead Volume Over Time (bar/area chart)

Week-over-Week % Change callout

3. Category Breakouts (Top 5 + “Other”)
Booking Type conversion rates

Event Type (Corporate / Wedding / Social)

Referral Source

Marketing Source

Each as a horizontal bar chart annotated with % (n=…).

4. Timing Factors
Days Until Event (bins: ≤7d, 8–30d, 31–90d, 90+d)

Days Since Inquiry (0d, 1–3d, 4–7d, 8–30d, 30+d)

Submission Weekday (Mon–Sun bar chart)

Submission Hour (0–23 line or heatmap)

5. Price & Size Effects
Number of Guests (1–50, 51–100, 101–200, 201–500, 500+)

Price-Per-Guest bins (<$50, $50–99, $100–199, $200+)

Staff-to-Guest Ratio (<1%, 1–2%, 2–5%, >5%)

6. Deal Value Insights
Average Deal Value by category (Booking Type, Region)

Total Revenue over time (monthly bar chart)

Average Price-Per-Guest trend

7. Geographic Analysis
Conversion by State/Region (map or bar chart)

Top 5 “Hot” ZIP codes or Cities

Phone-Area-Code Match uplift table

8. Funnel Stage Conversion
If you have multi-stage data (New → Contacted → Proposal Sent → Won/Lost), show stage-to-stage drop-off rates as a funnel chart.

9. Data Quality & Anomalies
% Missing per key field (State, Event Date, Phone)

Negative or zero Days-Until-Event count

Outlier detection on “Days Until” (>365 days) or “Guests” (>1,000)

10. Executive Call-outs
Underneath each chart, auto-extract and display:

• Best Performing Bucket: e.g. “≤7d out leads close at 45%”
• Worst Performing Bucket: e.g. “30+d out leads close at 8%”

as simple st.metric() calls with green/red arrows.

Bonus Deep-Dives (if you want to stretch)
Cohort Analysis: conversion by inquiry month cohort over time

Retention / Repeat Business: % of clients who book again

Correlation Sparkline: tiny in-line sparkline next to each feature in a table

Drill-through Links: clicking a bar filters the whole page to that bucket
