Unique Status Values In Leads Export


Here’s what we see in your Leads Export:

Status Value	Count
Lost	15930
Lead	6999
Definite	3008
(blank)	2687
Tentative	314

Why your dashboard showed 0 “Won” deals

We were only mapping “definite” (lowercased) to wins, but your raw has “Definite” (capitalized) and also “Tentative” as a status.

Also your code looked for “definte” misspelling—so “Definite” matched, but “Tentative” didn’t.

The large “Lead” and blank entries were ignored, so they weren’t counted as wins or losses.

Next steps to fix your dashboard
Map all winning statuses (Definite, maybe Tentative if that counts as a win)

Map losses explicitly (Lost)

Treat blanks and “Lead” as unresolved—either filter them out or classify as cold.

Updated mapping logic
In your process_data (or your load script), replace:

python
Copy
Edit
df['Status'] = df['Status'].astype(str).str.lower().str.strip()
df['Won']    = df['Status'].isin(['definite','definte'])
df['Lost']   = df['Status'] == 'lost'
with:

python
Copy
Edit
# Normalize and map outcomes
status = df['Status'].astype(str).str.strip().str.lower()

# Define win/loss sets
wins  = {'definite', 'tentative'}    # include tentative if you want
losses = {'lost'}

df['Outcome'] = status.map(lambda s: 1 if s in wins 
                                     else 0 if s in losses 
                                     else np.nan)
# Then drop rows where Outcome is NaN (unresolved leads)
df = df.dropna(subset=['Outcome'])
After that, rerun your dashboard. You should see:

Won Deals = 3008 (or 3322 if including “Tentative”)

Lost Deals = 15930

A real conversion rate

Then your lead-scoring model can actually train on real won vs. lost data. Give that a try and let me know how the numbers look!
