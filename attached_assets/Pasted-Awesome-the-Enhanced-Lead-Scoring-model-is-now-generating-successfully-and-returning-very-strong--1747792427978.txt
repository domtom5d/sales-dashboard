Awesome ‚Äî the Enhanced Lead Scoring model is now generating successfully and returning *very strong* performance:

### üî• Current Model Snapshot:

* **ROC AUC:** 0.946 ‚Äî **Excellent**, suggests the model is highly effective at distinguishing won vs. lost leads
* **Accuracy:** 92.4%
* **F1 Score:** 0.677 ‚Äî good balance of precision and recall
* **Avg. Half-Life:** 30 days ‚Äî captures how lead quality decays over time

### üöß Remaining Issue

You‚Äôre hitting this error in the **Lead Score Distribution** chart:

```
Error plotting score distributions: only integers, slices (:), ellipsis (...), numpy.newaxis (None) and integer or boolean arrays are valid indices
```

This usually means somewhere you're doing something like:

```python
data[score_thresholds]  # where score_thresholds is a float or dict, not an int or proper index
```

---

### ‚úÖ What to Do Next (Fix the Distribution Chart)

Let‚Äôs patch this up. In your `enhanced_lead_scoring_tab.py` (or wherever `plot_score_distribution()` lives), do the following:

#### üîß 1. Check your indexing

Find this block (or similar):

```python
won_scores = df[df['outcome'] == 'Won']['score']
lost_scores = df[df['outcome'] == 'Lost']['score']
threshold = thresholds['warm']  # make sure 'thresholds' is a dict
```

Then **make sure** when plotting, you're passing clean arrays ‚Äî not objects or invalid indices:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_score_distribution(won_scores, lost_scores, thresholds):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.hist(won_scores, bins=30, alpha=0.5, label='Won Leads')
    ax.hist(lost_scores, bins=30, alpha=0.5, label='Lost Leads')
    
    # Draw threshold lines
    for label, value in thresholds.items():
        ax.axvline(value, linestyle='--', label=f'{label.capitalize()} Threshold')

    ax.set_xlabel('Lead Score')
    ax.set_ylabel('Frequency')
    ax.set_title('Lead Score Distribution')
    ax.legend()
    return fig
```

Then in `render_enhanced_lead_scoring_tab()`:

```python
fig = plot_score_distribution(won_scores, lost_scores, thresholds)
st.pyplot(fig)
```

---

### üß† Quick Tips

If `thresholds` is coming in as a DataFrame or nested object, make sure you do:

```python
thresholds = {
    'hot': float(threshold_df.loc['hot', 'value']),
    'warm': float(threshold_df.loc['warm', 'value']),
    ...
}
```

### ‚úÖ Once that‚Äôs fixed‚Ä¶

* You‚Äôll unlock the **Lead Score Distribution chart**, which is key for visualizing how well the model separates winners from losers.
* Then we‚Äôre ready to:

  * Export predictions for top-scoring leads
  * Create filters to show only ‚ÄúHot‚Äù or ‚ÄúWarm‚Äù leads
  * Embed alerts / auto-email flows via Zapier, Streak, or Nowsta
