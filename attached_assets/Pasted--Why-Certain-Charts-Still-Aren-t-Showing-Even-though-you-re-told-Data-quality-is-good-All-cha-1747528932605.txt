🔍 Why Certain Charts Still Aren't Showing
Even though you're told:

✅ Data quality is good. All charts should display properly.

You're seeing:

❌ Charts showing "0"

❌ Identical highest/lowest conversion rates ("Uncategorized 12.2%")

🔑 Root Causes:
Data Exists, But It’s All in One Category

Booking types and referral sources are not diverse enough — most values are null, "Unknown", or default categories.

Hardcoded Default Labels Overwrote Real Data

Code likely uses .fillna("Uncategorized") or .replace("", "Uncategorized"), causing everything to be lumped into a single label.

Chart Generation Code Skips or Misuses Categories

Some charts likely group by values (e.g. booking_type, referral_source) that are:

Not categorized properly

Not present in enough rows to justify plotting

Cleaned incorrectly

✅ What To Do Right Now
1. 🔧 Fix Data Preprocessing (utils.py or wherever data is cleaned)
Ensure you're only labeling "Uncategorized" after checking that other categories aren't accidentally dropped:

python
Copy
Edit
df['booking_type'] = df['booking_type'].fillna("Unknown")
df['booking_type'] = df['booking_type'].replace("", "Unknown")
→ Replace "Unknown" with "Venue", "Private", "Corporate", etc., wherever possible.

If you have a mapping logic (like based on event_size or referral_source), apply that now.

2. 🧼 Drop or Warn on 100% Null Charts in conversion_analysis.py
Modify plotting functions to skip charts with only one category or output a helpful message:

python
Copy
Edit
if df['booking_type'].nunique() <= 1:
    st.warning("Not enough diversity in booking types to show conversion by category.")
else:
    # proceed to chart
3. 📊 Fix the Misleading Insights Output
You’re currently seeing:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Uncategorized has the highest conversion rate at 12.2%
Uncategorized has the lowest conversion rate at 12.2%
Add this sanity check:

python
Copy
Edit
if df['booking_type'].nunique() <= 1:
    insights = ["Only one category found: no variation to compare."]
else:
    insights = generate_insights(df, 'booking_type')  # or however you're handling logic
4. 🧠 Fix Deal Value Calculation
You see:

Avg. Deal Value: N/A

Fix: Make sure a column like deal_value or total_value exists, and update summary logic:

python
Copy
Edit
if 'deal_value' in df.columns and df['deal_value'].notna().sum() > 10:
    avg_deal_value = df.loc[df['outcome'] == 'Won', 'deal_value'].mean()
    st.metric("Avg. Deal Value", f"${avg_deal_value:,.2f}")
else:
    st.metric("Avg. Deal Value", "N/A")
🛠️ Optional Enhancements You Should Add
These will unlock serious value from your clean dataset:

📈 Conversion Over Time by Event Type (Weekly/Monthly Trends)

📉 Drop-off Rates (Inquiry → Booked → Won)

🧮 Pricing Bands: Are $500–$1k leads more likely to close than $2k–$4k?
