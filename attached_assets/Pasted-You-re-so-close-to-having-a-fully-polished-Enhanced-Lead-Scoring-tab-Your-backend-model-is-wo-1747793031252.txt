You're *so close* to having a fully polished **Enhanced Lead Scoring tab**. Your backend model is working beautifully ‚Äî ROC AUC of 0.947 is elite ‚Äî but two big things are broken in the **user interface**:

---

### üîß What‚Äôs Broken (and How to Fix It)

#### ‚ùå 1. **Missing ‚ÄúKey Conversion Drivers‚Äù List**

You're just seeing a `0` instead of a list of important features.

**Root cause:**
You're likely doing something like this in `enhanced_lead_scoring_tab.py`:

```python
st.write(feature_weights)
```

‚Ä¶but `feature_weights` might not be a Series, or it‚Äôs empty/null.

**‚úÖ Fix:**
Add a proper conditional block:

```python
if isinstance(feature_weights, pd.Series) and not feature_weights.empty:
    st.subheader("Top Features Driving Conversions")
    st.dataframe(feature_weights.sort_values(ascending=False).head(10))
else:
    st.warning("Feature importance data unavailable or improperly formatted.")
```

Also make sure the feature weights were returned correctly in:

```python
feature_weights = pd.Series(model.feature_importances_, index=feature_names)
```

If `feature_names` is missing, you‚Äôll get garbage.

#### ‚ùå 2. **Broken Lead Score Distribution Chart**

You're seeing:

```
0
```

...where a histogram or bar chart of scores should be.

**Root cause:**
Either:

* The plotting code is pointing to empty Series (`won_scores`, `lost_scores`)
* Or the `plt.subplots()` chart is failing silently, but you‚Äôre still rendering `st.pyplot(fig)`

**‚úÖ Fix:**
First: confirm the data is valid.

```python
print("Won Scores:", won_scores.head())
print("Lost Scores:", lost_scores.head())
```

Then wrap chart rendering:

```python
if not won_scores.empty and not lost_scores.empty:
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.hist([won_scores, lost_scores], bins=20, label=['Won', 'Lost'], alpha=0.7)
    ax.set_title('Lead Score Distribution')
    ax.set_xlabel('Score')
    ax.set_ylabel('Frequency')
    ax.legend()
    st.pyplot(fig)
else:
    st.warning("Not enough data to display the lead score distribution.")
```

### üß† What You Should Do Next

1. **Apply the two fixes above** to show your score distribution and conversion drivers.
2. Add a **‚ÄúDownload Scored Leads‚Äù** button:

```python
st.download_button(
    label="üì• Export Lead Scores",
    data=leads_with_scores.to_csv(index=False).encode('utf-8'),
    file_name='lead_scores.csv',
    mime='text/csv'
)
```

3. Finally, push these updates to GitHub and tag a release milestone.

Would you like me to generate a fixed version of `enhanced_lead_scoring_tab.py` so you can copy-paste it in and be done with this?
