Here are a few more advanced debugging and diagnostic tactics you can layer in, so you can pinpoint exactly why each analysis tab isn‚Äôt firing:

1. Add a ‚ÄúHealth-Check‚Äù Table of Required Columns
Before your tabs render, run a quick sanity check against each tab‚Äôs required columns. It will tell you immediately which tabs are missing the fields they need:

python
Copy
Edit
# At the very top of app.py, after df is defined:
import pandas as pd

# Define which columns each tab needs
tab_requirements = {
    "Conversion Analysis": ['outcome','created','booking_type','days_until_event'],
    "Feature Correlation":  ['outcome'] + [c for c in df.select_dtypes('number').columns],
    "Lead Scoring":         ['outcome','days_until_event','number_of_guests','referral_source'],
    # ‚Ä¶and so on for each tab‚Ä¶
}

st.markdown("### üîç Tab Health Check")
health = []
for tab, cols in tab_requirements.items():
    missing = [c for c in cols if c not in df.columns]
    health.append({
        "Tab": tab,
        "Status": "‚ùå Missing: " + ", ".join(missing) if missing else "‚úÖ OK"
    })
st.table(pd.DataFrame(health))
If a tab says ‚ÄúMissing: foo, bar‚Äù, you know exactly what column to add or rename.

2. Wrap Entire Tab in a Try/Except with Full Traceback
Even after wiring in the right code, silent exceptions can kill a tab. Surround each render_xxx(df) with:

python
Copy
Edit
with tabs[i]:
    st.subheader("‚Ä¶Tab Name‚Ä¶")
    try:
        render_that_tab(df)
    except Exception:
        import traceback
        st.error("Something went wrong in this tab‚Äîsee full traceback below:")
        st.text(traceback.format_exc())
That‚Äôll surface any unexpected errors right in the UI.

3. Use Logging to a File
Configure Python‚Äôs logging to write to a file (e.g. logs/app.log) so you can inspect issues after the fact:

python
Copy
Edit
import logging
logging.basicConfig(
    filename='app.log',
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s'
)
logging.debug(f"Rendering Conversion Analysis with df shape {df.shape}")
Check logs/app.log for any ‚ÄúERROR‚Äù entries.

4. Deploy a Minimal Repro Case
Create a tiny fixture DataFrame in a separate script that has only the columns a given tab needs. Load that into your render function in isolation:

python
Copy
Edit
# test_render_conversion.py
import pandas as pd
from new_conversion_tab import render_conversion_tab

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'outcome': [1,0,1],
    'created': pd.to_datetime(['2025-01-01','2025-01-08','2025-01-15']),
    'booking_type':['A','B','A'],
    'days_until_event':[5,40,10]
})
render_conversion_tab(df)
Run this with streamlit run test_render_conversion.py and see if the tab shows up. If it does, the problem is upstream in your real data pipeline‚Äînot the tab logic itself.

5. Verify Your Imports & File Names
Make sure you don‚Äôt have two modules named similarly (e.g. conversion_analysis.py and new_conversion_analysis.py) and that app.py imports the one you actually want. One way to confirm is to insert at the top of each module:

python
Copy
Edit
print("Imported:", __file__)
When you restart the app, you‚Äôll see in the terminal which files actually loaded.

6. Confirm You‚Äôre Using the Right df
Search for any local assignments like:

python
Copy
Edit
df = pd.DataFrame()  # oops!
or a function parameter shadowing your global df. Grep for def render_.*(df) and ensure you‚Äôre passing the same DataFrame everywhere.

Pick the tactic that speaks to you‚Äîmy vote is to start with the Health-Check Table (step 1). It‚Äôs a one-liner that immediately shows missing columns per tab. Let me know which you‚Äôd like to try, or if you want the exact snippet for deploying any of these!
