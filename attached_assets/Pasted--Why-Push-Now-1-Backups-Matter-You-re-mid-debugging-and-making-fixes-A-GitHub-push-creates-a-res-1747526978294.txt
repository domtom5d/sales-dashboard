✅ Why Push Now?
1. Backups Matter
You're mid-debugging and making fixes. A GitHub push creates a restore point in case Replit crashes, files are overwritten, or something breaks badly.

2. Track Your Progress
You’ve done a ton:

Set up the entire dashboard structure

Integrated lead scoring, decay, filtering, cohorting

Added agent support and even SSH/GitHub sync

Pushing to GitHub makes it easier to see what changed and when.

3. You’re Working With AI Agents
If you're testing Mistral agents or plan to add Zapier, it's smart to keep a synced repo to test modular changes branch-by-branch.

🛠️ How to Push (SSH Already Set Up)
You've already set up SSH and remotes, so just run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "🛠️ Update dashboard code: debug chart rendering and add failover warnings"
git push origin main
If you changed a lot and want to checkpoint it more safely:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout -b debug-fix-charts
git push origin debug-fix-charts
That way you can merge once it’s stable.

🔁 Bonus: Add a .TODO.md File
You’re juggling:

Data visualization fixes

AI responder logic

Nowsta + Streak integration

Make a .TODO.md in your root directory with what’s left. I can generate that file right now for you if you want.

Let me know when it’s pushed — I’ll help you clean or annotate it next.

## ✅ Completed

- Set up GitHub remote and SSH key
- Built Replit environment for Streamlit dashboard
- Implemented lead scoring model and decay logic
- Enabled AI agent via AG_SECRET
- Created conversion analysis UI structure

---

## 🔧 In Progress

### 🔹 Dashboard Fixes
- [ ] Fix missing charts in "Conversion by Time Factors"
- [ ] Diagnose why "Days Until Event" and "Days Since Inquiry" return empty or NaN
- [ ] Ensure `booking_type`, `event_type`, `referral_source` are normalized
- [ ] Improve formatting of missing field visualizations

### 🔹 GitHub
- [ ] Push current debugged version to `main` branch
- [ ] Create `debug-fix-charts` branch for current issue if needed

---

## 🚀 Next Features

- [ ] **AI Email Responder**: Train on Gmail data and integrate with Mistral agent
- [ ] **Nowsta Integration**: Create a Zap or code module that syncs confirmed streak deals with Nowsta scheduling
- [ ] **Lead Score Cohort Breakdown**: Split scoring logic per event category (e.g., wedding vs. corporate)
- [ ] **Lead Velocity**: Measure pipeline speed by rep or funnel stage

---

## 📌 Notes
- Use `.secrets` for AG_SECRET and GitHub PAT securely
- AI-powered insights should continue using Mistral Agent ID `ag:2db7b0b8:20250516:sales:7dbfb252`

# Save the file in the current working directory
todo_path = Path("/mnt/data/.TODO.md")

todo_path.name  # Output the name so user knows what was created
Result
'.TODO.md'
✅ I’ve created a detailed project TODO list and saved it as .TODO.md. You can download it below, commit it to GitHub, or use it directly for task tracking:

Download .TODO.md

Let’s now push your current codebase to GitHub as-is. Since everything is functioning (though some charts are missing), it’s safe to commit the latest state. If you're ready, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Checkpoint: working version with AI scoring, charts WIP"
git push
