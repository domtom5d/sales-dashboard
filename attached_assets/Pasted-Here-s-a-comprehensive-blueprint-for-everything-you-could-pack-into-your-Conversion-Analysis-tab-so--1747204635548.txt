Here’s a comprehensive blueprint for everything you could pack into your Conversion Analysis tab—so it tells the full story of how leads move (or don’t) through your funnel. Organize it top‐to‐bottom as a logical narrative:

1. KPI Summary Cards
Display four big, bold numbers up top:

Total Leads (count of resolved + unresolved submissions)

Won Deals (Definite + Tentative)

Lost Deals

Overall Conversion Rate (Won ÷ (Won + Lost))

With a mini sparkline underneath showing the weekly trend of that Conversion Rate.

2. Date & Status Filters
Allow users to drill the entire tab by:

Date Range (Submission Date or Inquiry Date)

Status (All / Only Won / Only Lost)

State or Region (multi-select)

3. Trend Analysis
Conversion Rate Over Time

Line chart of daily or weekly conversion rate.

Overlay total lead-count line on a secondary axis for context.

Lead Volume Over Time

Bar or area chart of raw submissions vs. closed deals.

Week-over-week % change indicator.

4. Top-Level Drill-Downs
For each, show a horizontal bar chart sorted by conversion rate, annotated with “n=” sample size, and only the top 5 (rest grouped into “Other”):

By Booking Type (cleaned & aggregated)

By Event Type (Corporate vs. Wedding vs. Private Party vs. Other)

By Referral Source (Referral vs. Facebook vs. Google vs. Other)

By Marketing Source (Ad campaigns, Organic, etc.)

5. Timing-Based Breakouts
Days Until Event

Bins: ≤ 7d, 8–30d, 31–90d, > 90d

Bar chart of conversion% by bin.

Days Since Inquiry

Bins: 0 d, 1–3 d, 4–7 d, 8–30 d, > 30 d

Submission Hour

Line or bar chart of conversion% by hour of day (0–23).

Submission Weekday

Bar chart of conversion% Mon–Sun.

6. Price & Size Effects
Price-Per-Guest

Bins: < $50, $50–99, $100–199, ≥ $200

Number of Guests

Bins: 1–50, 51–100, 101–200, > 200

Staff-to-Guest Ratio

Bins: < 1%, 1–2%, 2–5%, > 5% (bartenders/guests)

7. Geographic Insights
Conversion by State/Region

Map or bar chart showing geographic hotspots & cold zones.

Area-Code Match

Table: Local vs. Non-Local phone match conversion rates.

8. Data-Quality & Anomalies
Missing Data Summary

% missing per key field (State, Phone, Event Date)

Link or download all rows with any missing values

Outliers

Count of negative or implausible “Days Until Event”

Any zero-guest submissions flagged

9. Highlight Best & Worst
Under each chart, automatically call out the highest and lowest performing bucket, e.g.:

“Leads ≤ 7d out convert > 30d out by 35 percentage points.”

10. Quick “What’s Next?” Panel
At the bottom, summarize 3–5 actionable take-aways from this tab, e.g.:

“Prioritize sub-7-day inquiries—45% close rate vs. 8% for > 30 days.”

“Corporate events (25%) outperform weddings (12%).”

“Price-per-guest > $200 yields 30% conversion—consider upsell focus.”

Optional Extras
Export CSV of filtered leads.

Embed tooltips on hover to explain each metric.

Collapsible sections (st.expander) to hide deep dives until needed.

With this full suite—KPIs, trends, breakouts, quality checks, and real-time insights—you’ll transform your Conversion Analysis page into a single pane of glass for pinpointing exactly where your funnel wins (and where it leaks).
