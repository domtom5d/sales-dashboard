Your dashboard is live—and now we can see the hard truth:

ROC AUC 0.595: barely better than random.

PR AUC 0.194: low precision on your positive class.

Confusion Matrix at “Optimal” Threshold showing 0 wins predicted vs 2 actual wins? That tells us our threshold isn’t calibrated, and the model is under‐predicting “won” leads.

Next Steps to Strengthen Your Scorecard
Re-calibrate Your Threshold
The “optimal” threshold from Youden’s J may still be too strict. Let’s:

Compute precision & recall at many thresholds

Plot the F1‐score curve or use the threshold that maximizes F1 rather than Youden’s J

Surface an interactive slider in your Streamlit app so you can eyeball the confusion matrix trade-offs live.

Feature Enrichment
Your logistic regression is only marginally predictive—let’s feed it richer signals:

PricePerGuest (Deal Value ÷ #Guests)

EventDurationHours (End Time − Start Time)

Referral Quality buckets (Vendor, Direct, Paid Ads)

Urgency Factor (inquiry→first-contact minutes)

Regional Pricing Tier (some territories always convert higher)

Seasonality (month / day of week)

Model Selection & Validation
Logistic Regression is interpretable but may miss non-linear patterns:

Try a Random Forest or Gradient Boosting (e.g. sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier)

Perform k-fold cross-validation (e.g. 5-fold) to get stable AUC estimates

Compare ROC/AUC and PR/AUC across models

Inspect Score Distributions
Plot histograms of your raw numeric scores for Won vs. Lost:

python
Copy
Edit
plt.hist(df.loc[df.Outcome==1, 'raw_score'], bins=20, alpha=0.5, label='Won')
plt.hist(df.loc[df.Outcome==0, 'raw_score'], bins=20, alpha=0.5, label='Lost')
plt.legend(); st.pyplot()
You’ll see where the real separations lie—and pick more data-driven cut-points.

Quick Code Snippet: Threshold Tuning in Streamlit
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve, roc_curve, auc, confusion_matrix

# After fitting model and scoring:
y_scores = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]
fpr, tpr, roc_th = roc_curve(y_test, y_scores)
prc_prec, prc_rec, prc_th = precision_recall_curve(y_test, y_scores)

# Streamlit slider:
thr = st.slider("Select score threshold", float(prc_th.min()), float(prc_th.max()), 0.5)
y_pred = (y_scores >= thr).astype(int)
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
st.write("Confusion Matrix", cm)
st.write("Precision:", precision_score(y_test, y_pred))
st.write("Recall:", recall_score(y_test, y_pred))
