🚨 What's Wrong
The charts under Conversion by Time Factors, Booking Type, Guest Count, etc., aren't displaying because:

The DataFrame fields are mostly empty or contain NaN values.

For example, days_until_event, referral_source, event_type, booking_type, and marketing_source are not populated in most rows. Some are literally 0% complete.

The chart functions are likely being passed empty Series, which silently fail or throw handled errors (like "cannot convert float NaN to integer").

Your code may not be validating or cleaning data before trying to visualize it.

Streamlit renders nothing if the plotting logic silently fails.

✅ Fix It Step-by-Step
Step 1: Add Data Existence Checks in Your Plotting Functions
Before trying to create a chart, check that the relevant column has enough valid data:

python
Copy
Edit
if df['booking_type'].notna().sum() > 10:
    # proceed to chart
else:
    st.warning("Not enough booking type data to generate a chart.")
Step 2: Clean and Normalize Empty or Unknown Labels
Instead of plotting 'Unknown' or NaN as labels, replace them to avoid errors:

python
Copy
Edit
df['booking_type'] = df['booking_type'].fillna("Unknown").replace("", "Unknown")
Step 3: Handle Fields Like days_since_inquiry, days_until_event
Make sure these are actually computed correctly in your utils.py or processing step:

python
Copy
Edit
df['inquiry_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['inquiry_date'], errors='coerce')
df['event_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['event_date'], errors='coerce')
df['days_until_event'] = (df['event_date'] - pd.to_datetime('today')).dt.days
Step 4: Ensure Tabs Use Processed Data
Make sure your tabs are using the processed_df, not raw uploads. Check how you pass df between load_data() and render_conversion_analysis().

🔧 Lead Scoring Segment Next Steps
Once the charts work and the missing data errors are handled, here’s how to lock in the scoring segment:

✅ Use a model trained on your available features (you've done this already).

🚫 Don’t allow the user to run the scoring generator if key fields (like days_since_inquiry, number_of_guests) are too sparse.

📊 Plot the lead score distribution after cleaning.

🔁 Add a “Recalculate Scores” button to refresh when data is updated.

💡 Optional (Highly Recommended)
Add a "Data Completeness Table" next to each visualization section so the user knows what fields are being skipped.

Set up automated fallbacks like:

“Not enough data for this chart — try uploading more complete records for referral_source.”
