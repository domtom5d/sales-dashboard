1. Unsupervised Segmentation + Hybrid Scoring
What: Run clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN, or Gaussian Mixtures) on your feature set (e.g. guests, days-until, budget, event type) to discover natural “lead personas.”

Why: You may find three or four distinct lead archetypes with wildly different close rates—and then apply separate scoring rubrics per cluster.

Next: Prototype in Python (e.g. use scikit-learn), visualize clusters in 2D (PCA/t-SNE), and compare each cluster’s historical conversion.

2. Ensemble ML Models
What: Combine logistic regression, gradient boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM), and a small neural net in a stacked ensemble.

Why: Boosting often uncovers non-linear interactions that a plain “coat rack” logistic model misses.

Next: Spin up a quick LightGBM run, check feature importances, then stack its predictions with your existing score for extra lift.

3. Natural-Language “Intent” Scoring
What: Apply an LLM or a simple TF-IDF + sentiment model to any free-text fields (“Tell us about your event”) to extract intent/enthusiasm signals.

Why: A carefully worded inquiry (“We absolutely need you!”) can outperform a bland form fill.

Next: Capture those text answers, vectorize them, and see if NLP-derived sentiment or keyword presence improves AUC.

4. Time-Decay & Dynamic Scoring
What: Let your score “decay” over time if you haven’t followed up, or increase when the prospect re-engages (email open, site revisit).

Why: A promising lead with no action in 48 hrs is no longer as hot as one you just called.

Next: Integrate your email-open data, website revisit logs, or manual “first contact” timestamps into a decaying booster function in your scoring code.

5. Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling
What: Build a Bayesian logistic model with region (or event type) as a hierarchical grouping variable—letting low-volume regions borrow “strength” from the global data.

Why: Prevents tiny-sample noise from overweighting obscure territories.

Next: Prototype in PyMC3 or Stan; infer posterior distributions for each region’s baseline conversion rate.

6. Survival / Hazard Analysis
What: Treat “time to close” as a survival problem—model the hazard rate of conversion over days since inquiry.

Why: Gives you both “will they convert?” and “likely when?”, enabling dynamic follow-up schedulers.

Next: Fit a Cox proportional hazards model; integrate its risk scores as another feature in your lead-score ensemble.

7. Multi-Armed Bandit Lead Allocation
What: Instead of statically routing “Hot” leads always to the same rep or process, run a small bandit algorithm that tests different outreach cadences or channels.

Why: Continuously arms-length optimizes your approach—e.g. should you text first or call first?

Next: Start with a simple ϵ-greedy or Thompson Sampling implementation in Python tied into your outreach logs.

8. External Enrichment & Signals
What: Append external data—weather forecasts, local event calendars, macro-economic indicators, even Google search trends for “wedding bartending” in that ZIP.

Why: Leads in your territory might convert differently if there’s a big festival or a heat-wave coming.

Next: Hook a free API (OpenWeather, Eventbrite) to pull a few contextual features at form-submit time.

How to Choose & Iterate
Rank by expected ROI: Which approach do you think will move the needle most?

Prototype fast: Spin up a quick Python notebook for one new feature or model.

Measure lift: Compare AUC/PR and bucket conversion vs. your baseline model.

Deploy in Zapier/Streak: Add the winning feature into your scoring code step or Streak formula.

Monitor: Track weekly performance; pare back anything that doesn’t help.

Which of these strikes you as the next frontier? Or do you have another wild idea you want to explore?
