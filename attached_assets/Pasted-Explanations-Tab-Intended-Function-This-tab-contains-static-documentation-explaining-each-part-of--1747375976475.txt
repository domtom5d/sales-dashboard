Explanations Tab
Intended Function: This tab contains static documentation, explaining each part of the dashboard and the metrics shown. It’s essentially a user guide within the app. Problems Identified: (This tab mostly involves content, not dynamic data, so issues are minimal.)
The content might not be fully written or might be outdated if changes were made to the dashboard. For example, if we added “Event Type” analysis, the explanation should mention it. If the filters have been adjusted, the text should reflect that “by default, all data is shown, but you can filter by date, status, or state using the controls...”.
Formatting: Ensure the markdown uses proper formatting (bullet lists, bold terms, etc.) to make it easily readable. The code already uses headings and bullet points in the markdown string for this tab.
Recommended Fixes:
Revise Content for Accuracy: Read through the explanations and update any parts necessary to match the current functionality. For instance, if the explanation still mentions a 90-day default filter, remove that or change it to note all-time data. If new insights or tabs were added, describe them. The user should be able to understand what each tab shows and how to interpret the charts.
Improve Clarity: Use bullet points for listing definitions (the code already shows numbering like “1. Conversion Summary – ...”). Make sure each metric (Total Leads, Conversion Rate, etc.) is explained in plain language. If any abbreviations or terms are used (like KPI, AI, etc.), ensure they’re explained for completeness.
No Technical Jargon: The explanations are for end users, so any references to “Logistic regression” or “Pearson correlation” should be minimized or explained non-technically. It’s fine to say “a statistical model” or “a correlation (which measures linear relationship from -1 to 1)” depending on audience. Since this is a sales dashboard, likely the readers are non-technical sales managers, so keep it high-level.
This tab doesn’t require code changes beyond editing the markdown text. Once updated, the Explanations tab will serve as a helpful reference, ensuring users get the most out of the dashboard’s features.
Lead Personas Tab
Intended Function: This tab aims to use unsupervised machine learning to segment the leads into distinct “personas” or clusters with similar characteristics. The idea is to discover natural groupings in the data (for example, one persona might be “Large event planners with long lead times” and another “Small last-minute inquiries”) and highlight how each persona behaves in terms of conversion. It’s a more advanced analysis to help tailor different sales approaches to different lead types. Problems Identified:
Not Implemented: Aside from a title and description, there’s no actual computation or visualization in this tab. The code doesn’t call any function (like generate_lead_personas) or perform clustering. Therefore, it currently shows just static text explaining what would happen, but no results.
No Trigger or Control: Ideally, for such analysis, you might have a button like “Identify Personas” since clustering can be intensive. Or it could run automatically on data load if it’s efficient. The code has neither, meaning nothing happens.
Clustering Approach Undefined: We need to decide on a method to cluster leads. Common choices are K-Means clustering on selected numeric features, hierarchical clustering, or even using PCA for dimensionality reduction then clustering. We also need to decide how many clusters (personas) to form – perhaps 3 to 5 clusters is a reasonable starting point unless we determine an optimal number via an algorithm.
Data Preparation for Clustering: The lead data has both numeric and categorical features. We should choose features that make sense for clustering. Likely candidates: days_until_event, number_of_guests, region/state (which can be one-hot or perhaps cluster by geography separately), lead_source (referral, marketing – could one-hot), etc. Too many features can dilute the clustering, so we should select a handful that capture the lead “profile.” Also, scaling features to a similar range is important for algorithms like K-Means (for example, days_until_event could range into the hundreds, whereas outcome is 0/1). The outcome shouldn’t be used in clustering since we want personas independent of conversion (though we will later evaluate each persona’s conversion rate).
Recommended Fixes:
Implement Clustering (K-Means): Introduce a function to perform clustering on the lead data. For example, use K-Means with a chosen number of clusters (say 4). Steps:
Select features for clustering. For instance: X = df[['days_until_event','number_of_guests','event_month','weekday','state']]. We might need to encode month and weekday (e.g. convert to numeric or one-hot). Or we could use only numeric features for simplicity: perhaps days_until_event, number_of_guests, and maybe actual_deal_value or total_serve_time if relevant. You can also include marketing_source vs referral_source as a binary (like one feature indicating if it was referral).
Preprocess: fill NaNs (e.g. guests NaN -> 0, days_until_event NaN -> some average or 0 if missing means event date not set), then standardize the numeric features (scaling each to mean 0, std 1) so that no one feature dominates due to scale. The Python sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler can be used.
Run KMeans: kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=42).fit(X_scaled). This will assign each lead a cluster label.
Attach cluster labels to the DataFrame: df['persona'] = kmeans.labels_.
Summarize each cluster: For each cluster, compute things like count of leads, average conversion rate (outcome mean), and profile stats (average guests, average days_until_event, most common marketing_source, etc.). This can form the persona description. For example, cluster 0 might have: 50 leads, 10% conversion, avg guests 20, avg lead time 3 days, mostly referral sources from social media – that might be “Small last-minute leads, low conversion”. We can derive these insights programmatically.
Display Persona Summaries: Present the findings in a clear format. For instance, use st.markdown to list each persona with a name and stats. You could auto-generate a simple name or description from the data (or even use the AI to label them, but that might be overkill). Even numbering them is fine: “Persona 1: description...”. Include details like “Avg guests: X, Avg lead time: Y days, Conversion rate: Z%”. Optionally, use a bar chart or pie chart to show the percentage of leads in each persona and their win rates side by side. For example, a bar chart of conversion rate by persona could be useful, or a horizontal bar of number of leads in each persona.
User Control: Add a button “Generate Lead Personas” that triggers the clustering, since it might take a moment. Under the hood, when clicked, run the clustering analysis and store results (like the persona summary DataFrame or the cluster labels). Alternatively, as the dataset isn’t huge, it could run automatically, but a button gives the user a sense of action. Use st.button and wrap the clustering in an if block so it doesn’t rerun on every app refresh unnecessarily.
Verify Cluster Meaningfulness: After implementing, check that the clusters formed do make sense. If not, you might tweak the features or number of clusters. This may be iterative. But a basic implementation with a few key features should yield some separation (for example, one cluster might group all leads with very high guest counts, another with very low days_until_event, etc.). Even if not perfect, any noticeable differences can be reported.
By adding this functionality, the Lead Personas tab will become interactive and insightful. Sales teams could use these personas to tailor communication (for example, quick-turnaround leads vs long-term planners might need different sales tactics). The cluster stats will also reveal which persona converts best, which could inform marketing focus.
